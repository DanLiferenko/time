use usb/ repo here directly, without @i - this is the only program where USb is used anyway, so it will help to make it more direct

use shift registers for led strip clock (not max72xx), as here:
    http://videooko.net/?p=895
    http://videooko.net/?p=854
(use the same procedure as in max.h (not SPI) and use one pin for clock and latch for all
shift registers and one pin for data for each shift register)
use 500mA when connecting to USB - this should be sufficient (max 39 segments may be on
at the same time, which is 390 mA, so it remains 110mA for arduino and shift registers)
HINT: set 500mA in USB.w and compare wireshark trace before and after
as an aside: how to check if usb-hub takes 500mA: use resistors on each port
and via usb doctor see when voltage starts to drop

see adc.w to control brightness

Connect bare 7-segment display to shift register to test
