use shift registers for led strip clock (not max72xx), as here:
    http://videooko.net/?p=895
    http://videooko.net/?p=854
(use the same procedure as in max.h (not SPI) and use one pin for clock and latch for all
shift registers and one pin for data for each shift register)
use 500mA when connecting to USB - this will be sufficient
HINT: set 500mA in USB.w and compare wireshark trace before and after
as an aside: how to check if usb-hub takes 500mA: use resistors on each port
and via usb doctor see when voltage starts to drop

see adc.w to control brightness
