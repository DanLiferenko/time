use shift registers for led strip clock (not max72xx), as here:
    http://videooko.net/?p=895
    http://videooko.net/?p=854
(use the same procedure as in max.h - not SPI - and use parallel for clock and latch, and
separate outputs for data for each shift register)
think how external 5V power will work with USB - read about VBUS in datasheet
or maybe use 500mA when connecting to USB instead of 5V power supply - use USB-doctor to check

see adc.w to control brightness
