For testing use arduino micro: usbasp programmes uses the same pins as SPI,
so we need both simultaneously, and pro-micro does not have them both,
while micro does - it has separate 6-pin socket for programmer.
Connect as this: SCK to upper left pin, DIN to lower left, CS to low
third from right, GND to low 6th from left and VCC to upper 6th
from left.
Also, in time.w comment 'PORTB |= 1 << PB0;' (on micro PB0 is not inverted).
NOTE: do not use zif socket with pro-micro - contact is awful, tried it
