For testing use arduino micro: usbasp programmes uses the same pins as SPI,
so we need both simultaneously, and pro-micro does not have them both,
while micro does - it has separate 6-pin socket for programmer.
Connect as this: SCK to upper left pin, DIN to lower left, CS to low
third from right, GND to low 6th from left and VCC to upper 6th
from left.
Also, in time.w comment 'PORTB |= 1 << PB0;' (on micro PB0 is not inverted).
NOTE: do not use zif socket with pro-micro - contact is awful, tried it
Note, that I decided use SPI instead of bitbang (as I did previously - see 'git log -p')
because it is easier to adjust (SPI has only one parameter to change (frequency), while
binbang has more, and latch can be set sufficiently big).
