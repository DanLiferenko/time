There are many ways to control the 16 pins on this device in order to display what we wish at any time. First we will be using a microcontroller, so the obvious brute force way to start would be to use 16 GPIO lines to either pull high or low each pin on the device in order to display a pattern on the LEDs. We could do better by using two 8-bit shift registers and shifting out two bytes to control the 16 pins, thus reducing the number of GPIO lines needed. We would also need to consider that we can only display either a single column or row at any time, as trying to control more than one column or row at the same time will lead to unintended LEDs being on as a side effect. We could try and handle the multiplexing in code
